# Robolectric *Katas*

Use this repository a starting point to complete Android code *katas*.

## Import

The `master` branch has Robolectric integrated. Simply import into Android Studio. Once the project is imported, ensure the tests run.

Create a [run configuration](http://blog.blundell-apps.com/how-to-run-robolectric-junit-tests-in-android-studio/) to run the tests from the IDE (my preferred method).

To run the tests from the command line, use `./gradlew check`.

> Note: To become comfortable with integrating Robolectric, you can use the ["Hello, Robolectric" of Android Activity Book](coreylatislaw.com/android-activity-book/) chapter or my Pocket Guide to TDD with Robolectric as a separate *kata*.

## *Katas*

Now that the project is configured, you're ready to work though some *katas*.
